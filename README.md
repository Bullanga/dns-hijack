# What is dns-hijack?

dns-hijack is a indispensible part of the [INITE project](https://github.com/xXIty/init "INITE github page"), which is a captive portal that uses the DNS hijacking technic. The dns-hijack is a dummy and stupid pseudo DNS  with the ability to apply some logics in the domains resolution.

# Installation

```sh
git clone https://github.com/dhap0/dns-hijack.git
cd dns-hijack
make
sudo ./dns


```

# How it works?
